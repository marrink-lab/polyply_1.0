class FragmentFinder():
    """
    This class enables finding and labelling of fragments
    in the all-atom description of molecules. Fragments are
    small networkx graphs. It makes a number of implicit
    assumptions:

    - the molecule is connected and acyclic
    - the residue graph of the molecule is linear
    - the nodes by index increase with increasing resid order
    - the graphs provided as fragment graphs follow the sequence
      of residues. For example, given a polymer A5-B2-C3-A3
      residue sequence, fragments should be provided as a list
      A,B,C,A. The length of the block does not matter.

    The algorithm loops over the fragments and finds a match
    between a fragment and the molecule graph using a subgraph
    isomorphism based on the element attribute. This match is
    then used to set the degree attribute on the fragment. Next
    all other subgraph isomorphisms are found under the condition
    that each found match must connected to the previous residue.
    Nodes are labelled with a resid and resname. This part is done
    by the `self.label_fragment_from_graph` class method.

    Subsequently, the algorithm proceeds to merge all left-over
    atoms to the residue they are connected with assining a resid
    and resname from that residue. This procedure is done by
    `self.label_unmatched_atoms`.

    Finally, the code goes over all residues and assigns a prefix to
    all terminal residues. In addition residues with the same resname
    are compared to each other using a subgraph isomorphism and if
    they are not isomorphic as result of assigning left-over atoms,
    the resname is appended by a number.
