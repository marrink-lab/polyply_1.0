def res_pattern_to_meta_mol(pattern):
    """
    Generate a :class:`polyply.MetaMolecule` from a
    pattern string describing a residue graph with the
    simplified big-smile syntax.

    The syntax scheme consists of two curly braces
    enclosing the residue graph sequence. It can contain
    any enumeration of residues by writing them as if they
    were smile atoms but the atomname is given by # + resname.
    This input fomat can handle branching as well ,however,
    macrocycles are currently not supported.

    General Pattern
    '{' + [#resname_1][#resname_2]... + '}'

    In addition to plain enumeration any residue may be
    followed by a '|' and an integer number that
    specifies how many times the given residue should
    be added within a sequence. For example, a pentamer
    of PEO can be written as:

    {[#PEO][#PEO][#PEO][#PEO][#PEO]}

    or

    {[#PEO]|5}

    The block syntax also applies to branches. Here the convention
    is that the complete branch including it's first anchoring
    residue is repeated. For example, to generate a PMA-g-PEG
    polymer containing 15 residues the following syntax is permitted:

    {[#PMA]([#PEO][#PEO])|5}

    Parameters
    ----------
    pattern: str
        a string describing the meta-molecule

    Returns
